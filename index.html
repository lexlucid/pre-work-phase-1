<h1>Prework Phase 1</h1>

<p>Git is version control software that we run on our computer</p>
<p>Github is a remote application that works with Git that helps us collaborate and share our code with others</p>
<p>ddc-web-student.cnm.edu is the bootcamp server that runs our code</p>
<p>We add and commit our code on our computer</p>
<p>We PUSH our code from our computer to Github</p>
<p>We DEPLOY our code from our computer to the bootcamp server</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are different!</p>
